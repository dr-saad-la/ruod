# Rust Outlier Detection (Ruod)

Rust Outlier detection library with Rust as the backend and with Python API. 


**RuOD** is a planned high-performance library for outlier detection, implemented in Rust with a Python API. The goal of this library is to provide a fast, lightweight solution for detecting outliers in large datasets without any external dependencies. RuOD will be designed to cater to real-time and large-scale applications, offering a suite of state-of-the-art algorithms accessible through both Rust and Python.

## Vision

- **High Performance**: Leverage Rustâ€™s speed and memory safety to create a library that can handle large-scale outlier detection tasks efficiently.
- **No Dependencies**: Implement the core functionality purely in Rust to avoid external dependencies, ensuring a lightweight and portable solution.
- **Python Integration**: Provide a seamless Python API, making the library accessible to the Python community without sacrificing performance.
- **Scalability**: Design the library to scale effectively across different data sizes and types, making it suitable for diverse applications.

## Planned Features

- **Isolation Forest (IForest)**: Efficiently isolates observations by randomly selecting features and split values, providing a robust method for outlier detection.
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Identifies anomalies by comparing the local density of a point to the densities of its neighbors, making it suitable for datasets with varying density.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Detects outliers by reducing the dimensionality of data, highlighting points that deviate significantly from principal components.
- **Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)**: Decomposes the data into low-rank and sparse components, with the sparse matrix highlighting outliers.

## Future Additions

- **Additional Algorithms**: Plan to include other outlier detection methods like DBSCAN, One-Class SVM, and more to provide a comprehensive toolkit.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Develop thorough documentation, including a detailed API reference, tutorials, and examples to help users understand and effectively use the library.
- **Benchmarking**: Integrate benchmarking tools to compare the performance of RuOD with other libraries, ensuring that it meets the highest standards of efficiency.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines to ensure that every update is stable, well-tested, and easy to deploy.

## Roadmap

1. **Initial Development**:
    - Implement core outlier detection algorithms in Rust.
    - Set up basic Python bindings using PyO3.
    - Create a simple command-line interface for testing and demonstration.

2. **Enhancements**:
    - Optimize the performance of the initial algorithms.
    - Expand the library with additional detection methods.
    - Develop comprehensive documentation and usage guides.

3. **Release**:
    - Package the library for release on crates.io (Rust) and PyPI (Python).
    - Promote community contributions and feedback.

4. **Maintenance and Growth**:
    - Continuously improve the library based on user feedback.
    - Add new features and algorithms as needed.
    - Maintain high standards of performance and code quality.

## Contribution Plans

Contributions will be welcome once the initial version of the library is released. We plan to encourage community involvement to help shape RuOD into a robust and versatile tool. Contributions could include:

- **New Algorithms**: Implementing new outlier detection methods.
- **Optimization**: Enhancing the performance of existing algorithms.
- **Documentation**: Improving the clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation.
- **Testing**: Adding tests and improving coverage to ensure the reliability of the library.
